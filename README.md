# Kovacs-et-al-Suboptimal-transcription-MBE
Code deposited for paper "Suboptimal global transcriptional response increases the harmful effects of loss-of-function mutations", Kovacs et al. Molecular Biology and Evolution

The script .init.R contains custom functions for the R environment. 

The script modes.R contains the code for extracting the modes from the M matrix, using svd. 

The script randomizations.R contains the code for performing the randomization of the M matrix in different ways, as described in the paper. 

The scripts named as the corrresponding figures (and panels) in the paper, contain the analyses needed to reproduce each of these figures.
